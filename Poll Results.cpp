/*****************************************************************************************************
 * 7. Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible
 *    values. The first input to the program is the poll question; the next three inputs are the
 *    possible answers. The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3.
 *    The answers are tallied until a 0 is entered. The program should then show the results of the
 *    pollâ€”try making a bar graph that shows the results properly scaled to fit on your screen no
 *    matter how many results were entered.
